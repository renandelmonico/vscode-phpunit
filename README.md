## Troubleshooting

### All tests are appearing twice with "\*** duplicate ID **\*" found.

You likely have a file sensitive file system. The default value of `"phpunit.files": "{test,tests,Test,Tests}/**/*Test.php",` should be changed to `"phpunit.files": "{test,tests}/**/*Test.php",`

### I'm using Vagrant / Homestead for remote execution

Your tests will list in the explorer for reading locally, but you need to run your tests remotely using PHP on your vagrant machine.

To do this you need to configure the following settings:

`"phpunit.relativeFilePath": true,` - This will ensure your files are located correctly for local checks

`"phpunit.phpunit": "/FULL_PATH_TO/vendor/bin/phpunit",` - your remote path, likely in `/var/www/html/`

`"phpunit.php": "/usr/local/bin/vagrant exec php",` this is to execute PHP on the remote machine. You'll need to install and configure https://github.com/p0deje/vagrant-exec - this wraps the command like using `ssh -C`

You can also use the method above to execute on Docker remotely

`"phpunit.docker": true, ` this is to enable run the tests into the docker container

`"phpunit.dockerImage": "docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w=$(pwd) php:8", ` this is to use the docker container to run the tests

### My `/usr/local/bin/vagrant` isn't found?

Spawn likely can't find vagrant locally. You need to switch to using your regular terminal using something like `"phpunit.shell": "/bin/bash",` or `"phpunit.shell": "/bin/zsh",`
